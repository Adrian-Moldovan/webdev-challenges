## CHALLENGE 1: Display a random number in the browser
Create a simple program that generates and displays a random number between 1 and 10 when the page loads.

**Requirements:**
1. The number should be generated using JavaScript and displayed inside an HTML element.
2. The number should be between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
3. The program should run when the page loads.

**Bonus:**
Display the number in a **random color** each time the page is refreshed.


## CHALLENGE 2: Random Challenge Picker
Create a program that selects and displays a random challenge (fun task, dare, or mini-activity) from a predefined list when the page loads.

**Requirements:**
1. Create an array with at least 5 funny or creative challenges (e.g., "Do 10 jumping jacks", "Talk like a pirate for the next 5 minutes").
2. When the page loads, display a random challenge inside an HTML element.
3. The challenge should change when the page is refreshed.

**Bonus**
Make the text animate in a fun way (e.g., fade-in effect).


## CHALLENGE 3: Random Rock-Paper-Scissors Picker
Create a program that randomly selects and displays Rock, Paper, or Scissors when the page loads. Instead of text, display an image representing the selected option.

**Requirements:**
1. Have three images (one for Rock, one for Paper, and one for Scissors).
2. When the page loads, display one of the images at random.
3. The selection should change when the page is refreshed.

**Bonus**
Add a caption below the image to display the chosen option (e.g., "You got: Rock!").


## CHALLENGE 4: Lottery Number Generator
Create a program that generates and displays a set of random lottery numbers when the page loads.

**Requirements:**
1. Generate 6 random numbers between 1 and 49 (or any standard lottery range you prefer).
2. Display the numbers inside an HTML element.
3. Make sure the numbers are unique (no duplicates).
4. The numbers should be different every time the page is refreshed.

**Bonus**
Display the numbers in a nice, styled way (e.g., inside colorful circles).


## CHALLENGE 5: Random Color Generator
Create a program that generates and displays a random color when the page loads.

**Requirements:**
1. Generate a random color using HEX (#rrggbb).
2. Display the color inside a centered square (e.g., 200px x 200px).
3. The color should change every time the page is refreshed.

**Bonus**
Display the color code (RGB or HEX) centered, below the square.


## CHALLENGE 6: Traffic Light Simulator
Create a program that simulates a traffic light, displaying red, yellow, and green lights that change automatically after a set time.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a traffic light structure with three circles (red, yellow, and green).
2. Only one light should be "on" at a time.
3. The lights should change automatically in a loop (Red → Green → Yellow → Red…).

**Bonus**
Each light should stay on for a realistic duration (Red: 3s, Green: 3s, Yellow: 1s).


## CHALLENGE 7: Countdown Timer
Create a countdown timer that starts from a predefined number of hours, minutes, and seconds. The timer should update every second until it reaches zero.

**Requirements:**
1. The timer should start from a specific hardcoded time (e.g., 01:30:00 for 1 hour, 30 minutes).
2. It should update dynamically in the DOM every second.
3. When the countdown reaches zero, display a message like "Time's up!".
4. The time should always be formatted as HH:MM:SS.
