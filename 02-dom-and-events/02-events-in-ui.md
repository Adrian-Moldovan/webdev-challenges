# EVENTS IN UI

## CHALLENGE 1: Display a Dice Roll for a Set of 2 Dice (with Images)
Create a program that simulates rolling two dice and displays the results as images when a button is clicked.

**Requirements:**
1. Create a button that, when clicked, generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 (simulating a dice roll).
2. Display the two dice results as images (you will need images for each number 1 through 6).
3. Each time the button is clicked, the dice images should update to show the result of the new roll.

**Bonus:**
Display a message with the sum of the two dice, or other additional details.


## CHALLENGE 2: Carrot in the Box ðŸ¥•
Create a UI that displays a number of squares, one of which hides a carrot. The user has to click on a square to reveal if it contains the carrot.

**Requirements:**
1. Grid of Squares: Create a grid of squares (e.g., 3x3, 4x4, etc.) where each square is clickable.
2. Hidden Carrot: Randomly hide a carrot in one of the squares. This can be done by adding a class or changing the square's content (e.g., a carrot emoji, image, or message).
3. User Interaction: When the user clicks on a square, the content of that square should be revealed (e.g., show "You found the carrot!" or a carrot image if the user clicks the correct square).
4. Feedback: Provide feedback to the user when they find the carrot (e.g., a success message, and an option to restart the game).

**Bonus:**
- After the carrot is found, allow the user to reset the grid and try again.
- Show the number of attempts it took to find the carrot.
- Include a countdown timer that shows the remaining time and stops the game when the time expires.
