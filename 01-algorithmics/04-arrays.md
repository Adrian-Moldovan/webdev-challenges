## CHALLENGE 4: Random Excuse Generator
Write a program that generates a random excuse. The program should:
1. Randomly select an introductory phrase (e.g., "Sorry, but...").
2. Select a "perpetrator" (e.g., "my dog," "the weather," etc.).
3. Choose a "motivation" (e.g., "ate my homework," "made a mess," etc.).
4. Combine these parts to form a complete, random excuse.

### Structure
**Introductory Phrases:**
- "Sorry, but..."
- "I can't believe it, but..."
- "I was planning to do it, but..."
- "This might sound crazy, but..."

**Perpetrators:**
- "my dog"
- "a drunken elf"
- "the pope"
- "your uncle on a skateboard"
- "Jesus and Budha"

**Motivations:**
- "insisted on playing a game of chess"
- "broke my computer"
- "made a mess"
- "stole my charger"
- "forced me to play rock paper scissors for 3 hours"

**Example** 
```
Input:  - 

Output: I was planning to do it, but your uncle on a skateboard stole my charger! 
```


## CHALLENGE 5: Lottery Number Draw
Write a program that simulates a lottery draw. The program should:

1. Randomly generate a set of winning numbers.
2. Allow the user to enter their chosen numbers.
3. Compare the user's numbers with the winning numbers and display how many matches they got.

**Example** 
```
Input: 
    3
    12
    19
    34
    40
    45

Output:
    Winning numbers: 5 12 23 34 41 45  
    Your numbers: 3 12 19 34 40 45  
    You matched 3 numbers!  
```

## CHALLENGE 6: Random Student Picker
Create a program that randomly picks a student’s name from a group of students.

### What your program should do ###
1. You already have a list of student names saved in your program (for example: "Ann", "Bob", "Chris").
2. Each time the user chooses to continue, your program should pick one random student from the list and display their name.
3. After showing the name, the program should ask the user if they want to pick another student.
    - If the user says “OK”: pick another student.
    - If the user says “Cancel” → show a goodbye message and stop the program.
4. Once a student has been picked, they cannot be picked again until all the other students have been picked at least once. After everyone has been picked once, the list resets and picking starts over again.

**Example** 
```
Students: Ann, Bob, Chris
Output: Press OK to pick a student, Cancel to stop:
Input: OK
Output: The randomly picked student is: Bob. Press OK to continue.
Input: OK
Output: Press OK to pick a student, Cancel to stop:
Input: OK
Output: The randomly picked student is: Ann. Press OK to continue.
Input: OK
Output: Press OK to pick a student, Cancel to stop:
Input: OK
Output: The randomly picked student is: Chris. Press OK to continue.
Input: OK
------
(At this point, everyone was picked, so the list resets.)
------
Output: Press OK to pick a student, Cancel to stop:
Input: OK
Output: The randomly picked student is: Bob. Press OK to continue.
Input: Cancel
Output: Thank you for using "Random Student Picker"!
